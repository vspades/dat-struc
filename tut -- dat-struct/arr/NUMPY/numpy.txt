Numpy is an extra module that could be added to python workspace, to
help with speeding up the execution-time (exe-time) of code-snippets.
In fact, it applies a method named "vectorization", to decrease the
exe-time. It is believed that, "vectorization" approach concerns these
two factors:
	- eliminiting for-loop: using in-line command instead of wrapping
	multi-lines under a for-loop structure.
	- homogeneity array: picking <array> data-structure over <list> for
	keeping the data.

eliminiting for-loop:
	Unlike conventional C-style coding, "Guido van Rossum", the designer
	of Python programming language, encourages the programmers to use
	in-line commands for applying a certain function on a vector of
	data. He names it as "Pythonic" in his article, All Things Pythonic [https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=98196].

homogeneity array:
	a <list> or a <linked-list> data-structure [illustration] , establishs a container for each element of the list that includes 3 parts:
		- pre-ptr: pointer that holds the address of the previous element-box in the memory.
		- data: a place to hold the actual raw data
		- nxt-ptr: a pointer that holds the address of the next element-box in the memory.
	needless to say, to traverse through them eleemnts, the compiler has to locate each begginign address of each elemnt that could be
	located in anywhere in the memory. no matter the next ellemtnt is the same type or else.
	on the other hand, the array has the homogeneity feature, that is all elements are the same type. in other word,
	the compiler only need to hold the begging address of the first elemnt, which is the begginging address of the array,
	and also need to know the size (length) of each eleemnt. since then, it could locate the other elemnts according to this formla:
	[formula]
	in this way, searching and traversing time will deacrease signifacntly.
	
the author brought this example to demonstrate a comprasion between using the list and array in python. the example is self-explained thanks to the comments whithin the
code:

#The main advantage of NumPy is the speed of the usual array operations compared
#to standard Python operations. For instance, a traditional summation of 10000000
#elements:

def sum_trad():
	start = time.time()
	X = range(10000000)
	Y = range(10000000)
	Z = []
	for i in range(len(X)):
		Z.append(X[i] + Y[i])
	return time.time() - start

#Compare this to the Numpy function:

def sum_numpy():
	start = time.time()
	X = np.arange(10000000)
	Y = np.arange(10000000)
	Z = X + Y
	return time.time() - start

print 'time sum:', sum_trad(),
print 'time sum numpy:', sum_numpy()

#time sun: 2.1142539978
#time sum numpy: 0.0807049274445

#The time used is 2.1142539978 and 0.0807049274445 respectively.

the example implicity, mentioned the two factors of the vectorizationed that we discusse earlier.
however, the author didnt explicity express the main role of ach facts in that example. therefore we extend the example to clarify the impact of each role in exe-time:

[example]

nevertheless, the author debated the fact number 1 in other example that we reapeat it here for a quicj discussion:

[exzample]

apparantly it doesnt seem to be reasonble or efficient to consider each possible instance with a question-mark in that. the data-analyzer
forced to include all samples with different number of spaces just to foloow the rule of vectorization. it seems that an efficient code would be 
somthing like this:

[code]

although it seems to be straight forward to comprehenf, but if one have this written in python programming, they unconseously 
increase the exe-time. beacause of using of for-loop., even if they define them variables using <array>. therefore, it seems that the author 
had no choice and had to go with rules of python vectorixations to make the code "pythonic".in the future work we will invastigate through a module named,
cython, so we can pass the numpy arrays to C and so we can apply them functions on those arrays with C-style foor-loops. as a rsult, we can have the benefit of modules in python and also 
the spped of C

there are a variouse tutorials to understand how to work with numpy module. specially, the official resource provided
by python here[referece].
in the following section, we provided a quick tutorial that include the most esssential materials that one need s to know, concerning the concept, that we have debated in this paper.

quick tutorial on NUmpy: 

In [7]: from os import system as s

In [8]: s('pip install numpy')


we start generating an instance of a <list>, which described before as <linked-list> data-stracture.
In []: v = [2, 6, 5, 9]

to verfiy its type, we would put:
In []: type(v)
Out[]: list

for the traverse-speed sake, it would be better to convert that list to array, or a numpy array, that we have explained its advantages before: 
In []: v = np.array(v)

now if we check with its type again, we would have:
In []: type(v)
Out[]: numpy.ndarray

probably no specific reason to convert an array to a list, after all them benefits, however for the matter of completeness:
In[]: v = list(v)

in python when you assign a value to a variable name, that name would be a new pointer to that value, indtead of a new copy.
in this way, python would consume the memory in more efficient way. afterall, if we want to have another copy of the data on the memory,
let's say for trying any function on that without manipulating the original one, we need to specifically announce that via this command:

In []: v = [1,2,3]

In []: v = np.array(v)

In [17]: v1 = np.array(v)

In [18]: v2 = v1

In [19]: v3 = v1.copy()

in the above enlisting we have the v2 to point to the v1, but have the v3 to contain a copy of that the v1 value. to verify our teory we would 
alter an element in each of them v2 and v3, and check with the value v1, to disguinish the original from the copy one.

In []: v1
Out[]: array([5, 2, 3])

In []: v3
Out[]: array([4, 2, 3]) 

speaking of manipulating them arrays, in the following we will descuss the methods of altering and also traversing the values:

v = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 2, 1]
v = np.array(v)
v[:3]
v[3]
v[3] = 5
v

hopefully some of them popular functions already have been made and ready to use. one could apply a method, related to statistic and etc,
to an array like this:

In []: v = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 2, 1]

In []: v = np.array(v)

In []: np.unique(v)
Out[]: array([1, 2, 3, 4])

In []: np.sort(v)
Out[]: array([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4])

in addition to find out the type of each elements in the array:
In [32]: v.dtype
Out[32]: dtype('int64')

also to convert them elemnts to other type:
In [34]: v.astype('float64')
Out[34]: array([1., 2., 3., 4., 4., 4., 2., 1.])

one could find out and reform the dimension of an array and so turn it into a matrix(2-dim array), or any number of other dimension (n-dim):

In [35]: v.shape
Out[35]: (8,)

In [36]: v.shape = [2,4]

In [37]: v
Out[37]: 
array([[1, 2, 3, 4],
       [4, 4, 2, 1]])

In [38]: v = v.flatten()

In [39]: v
Out[39]: array([1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 2, 1])

In [40]: v.shape = [4,2]

In [41]: v
Out[41]: 
array([[1, 2],
       [3, 4],
       [4, 4],
       [2, 1]])

print 2 in v
print 10 in v

In [5]: v = [1,2,3,4]

In [6]: v = np.array(v)

In [7]: v
Out[7]: array([1, 2, 3, 4])

In [8]: v + v
Out[8]: array([2, 4, 6, 8])

In [9]: v[v>2]
Out[9]: array([3, 4])
